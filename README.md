## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

In the beginning, setting up github and having to get my visual studio run json file was difficult. I had to troubleshoot it a lot and download node.js and then create a path in environment variables to get it to work. 

Also adding the topfunded and secondmostfunded games was challenging for me, I got confused a bit with what goes where. I couldn't implement "Backers" to be honest as shown in the last screenshot in Submission PDF.
